DLL called from one location used by many applications

namespaces are specified by 'using <namespace>'

- References show the available namespaces which are compiled into DLL's

- Building a debug exe allows ide to step through the code 

- Release is smaller

Debugging
- breakpoints
- step into
- step over

C#
 - strongly typed (must assign type and can't change type) - helps memory management
 int x (x is not an address its an Object!)0

 - object based

 - Strings are immutable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Classes
- objects and then rules and regulations

Constructors
If you create a constructor c# will not create a default constructor

DLL's are stored in one place in memory but each program takes a copy during run time

Languages compiled in visual studio are compiled to IL

Run on CLR using JIT
